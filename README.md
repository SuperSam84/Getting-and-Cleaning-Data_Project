# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

## Introduction
Project to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis of a set of variables collected from the accelerometers of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for a group of 30 individuals

## Contents
1. CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
2. README.md: information about this repository (This file)
3. run_analysis.R: R script that transforms the raw data set into a tidy data file.

## How it works
1. Clone this repository: git@github.com:SuperSam84/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Project.git
2. Download the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) for the project
4. Open a R console and extract the data to your root directory 
5. Run the script run_analysis.R script: source('run_analysis.R'), then execute the function run_analysis().

A new file named tidy_data.txt will be created in the working directory cointaing the cleaned data.
